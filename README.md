## ðŸ¦š Welcome

Graduate student @ IIIS, Tsinghua University.

Areas: quantum information, quantum many-body dynamics. Also, I am doing some machine learning for physics toys.

- Quantum errors and their correction.
- Open quantum system.
- Variational quantum algorithms.

Open-source code contributions:
- Entanglement calculation for `QuantumClifford.jl` -> QuantumSavory/QuantumClifford.jl/pull/59
- SHVQE implementation for `tensorcircuit` -> tencent-quantum-lab/tensorcircuit/pull/191
